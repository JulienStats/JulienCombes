This blog will serve as a self-reminder and a repository for useful software code that I can easily share with others.


I am currently in the first year of a PhD in Applied Mathematics. My research focuses on active learning applied to computer vision.
I am doing my PhD at Michelin, where there is a high demand for machine vision and not enough experts to label the data.

I love learning and am very curious but software development is far from being a strength.
